# Node customization 

In this example, we show how to use the node APIs to
conduct customization on a node. We can conduct the
following customization.

- Install software: this creates a `RUN` command inside `Dockerfile`
- Install files: this creates a `COPY` command inside `Dockerfile`
- Add commands: create entries in `start.sh`

The result of the API is provided in the inline comments.
